When we asks parents for money and for other things, we are so naturally to do it and without thinking too much.
If our parents refuse, we will be angry. 
But the fact is that they don¡¯t owe us, instead, we owes them and most of us don¡¯t know the meaning of gratitude. 
Don¡¯t take everything from our parents as a necessary. 
what,s happend?
